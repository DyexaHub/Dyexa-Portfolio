# 📄 **Personal Portfolio Website by DyexaHub**

# **V.2.0.1**

A modern, scalable, and modular personal portfolio website designed, developed, and optimized to showcase professional experience, technical skill sets, and demonstrative UI components.
This repository is published under the **MIT License**.

## 📌 **Overview**

This repository contains the complete source code of my personal portfolio website — a platform designed to present my work, professional background, and technical capabilities. The project is structured with clarity and maintainability in mind, utilizing a component-driven architecture and modern build technologies such as **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and modular configurations for enhanced scalability.

The goal of this project is to deliver a highly responsive, visually clean, and performance-optimized personal site that reflects my experience, ongoing learning journey, and coding standards.

## 🧩 **Key Features**

### **Frontend & UI**

* Built with **React + TypeScript** for type safety and predictable component behaviors.
* Modular directory structure (`components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, `styles/`) to support future expansion.
* Fully responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* Styled using **TailwindCSS** with structured configuration and utility-first styling.

### **Performance**

* Lightning-fast build system using **Vite**.
* Image optimization & lazy loading where applicable.
* Lightweight bundle output with minimized scripts and assets.

### **Development Workflow**

* ESLint-based linting for code consistency.
* EditorConfig and TSConfig for uniform formatting.
* Pre-configured scripts for development, preview, and production builds.

## 🔐 **Security & Privacy Notes**

This repository intentionally does **not** include certain components or configuration files due to privacy, security, and personal data considerations. Some items are **strictly prohibited** from being uploaded publicly, such as:

### ❌ **Sensitive Environment Variables**

* `.env`
* `.env.production`
* `.env.local`

These files often contain:

* API keys
* Authentication tokens
* Private service credentials
* Backend endpoints

**These will never be published in this repository.**

### ❌ **Local Machine & Personal Workspace Files**

* `settings.json`
* `extensions.json`
* `.vscode/` configurations
* System-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, etc.)

These may reveal personal workspace configurations or system-level paths and are therefore excluded from the repository.

### ❌ **Backend Credentials or Private Internal Tools**

Any internal scripts, identity-linked resources, or non-public assets have been intentionally omitted.

All omitted files are replaced with safe public alternatives or mock placeholders where necessary to maintain project functionality for community viewing.
